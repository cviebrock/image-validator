# Image-Validator

Extra validation rules for dealing with images in Laravel 5.

> *NOTE*: As of Laravel version 5.2, there are now
[built-in validation rules for image dimensions and aspect ratios](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-dimensions).
> This package is not required and will no longer be maintained.

## Installation

> **NOTE**: Depending on your version of Laravel, you should install a different
> version of the package:
> 
> | Laravel Version | Package Version |
> |:---------------:|:---------------:|
> |       4.*       |       1.x       |
> |     5.0–5.3     |       2.1†      |
> |       5.4       |       2.2†      |
> |       5.5       |  not supported† |
>
> † Laravel 5.2 and later have [built-in validation rules for image dimensions](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/validation#rule-dimensions).

Install the package through [Composer](http://getcomposer.org).

```shell
composer require "cviebrock/image-validator"
```

Add the following to your `providers` array in `app/config/app.php`:

```php
'providers' => [
    ...
    \Cviebrock\ImageValidator\ImageValidatorServiceProvider::class,
],
```



## Usage

Use it like any `Validator` rule.  The package offers two rules for image validation:

### image_size

```php
$rules = [
    'my_image_field' => 'image_size:<width>[,<height>]',
];
```

The values for _width_ and _height can be integers, or integers with a modifier prefix:

- `300` or `=300` means the dimension must be exactly 300 pixels.
- `<300` means the dimension must be less than 300 pixels
- `<=300` means the dimension must be less than or equal to 300 pixels
- `>300` means the dimension must be greater than 300 pixels
- `>=300` means the dimension must be greater than or equal to 300 pixels
- `200-300` means the dimension must be between 200 and 300 pixels (inclusive)
- `*` means the dimension can be any value

If you only pass one value, it's assumed to apply to both dimensions 
(i.e. a square image with the given dimensions).

### image_aspect

```php
$rules = [
    'my_image_field' => 'image_aspect:<ratio>',
];
```

The value for _ratio_ represents _width ÷ height_ and be either a decimal or 
two values (width, height; both integers):

- `0.75`
- `3,4`

The value (or first value, if providing height and width) can also be prefixed 
with a tilde `~` character, in which case the orientation does not matter:

- `~3,4` means the image can have an aspect ratio of either 3:4 or 4:3.

Note that you may run into issues with floating point rounding.


## Examples

```php
// logo must be 300px wide by 400px tall
$rules = [
    'logo' => 'required|image|image_size:300,400',
];

// logo must be less than or equal to 300x300px.
$rules = [
    'logo' => 'required|image|image_size:<=300',
];

// logo must be 300px wide but can be any height
$rules = [
    'logo' => 'required|image|image_size:300,*',
];

// logo must be at least 100px tall and 200-300 pixels wide (inclusive)
$rules = [
    'logo' => 'required|image|image_size:>=100,200-300',
];

// logo must be square
$rules = [
    'logo' => 'required|image|image_aspect:1',
];

// logo must be ready for the big screen TV :)
$rules = [
    'logo' => 'required|image|image_aspect:16,9',
];
```
